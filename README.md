# drum-kit
created interactive drum kit using node.js with the Appbrewery
The website is like a virtual jam session. 
It's fully interactive and lets you be part of a band without leaving your desk, thanks to the magic of JavaScript. 
The idea is to allow anyone who swings by the site to tap into their inner musician.
